# Las Mari's Awesome Profile Cards

Our cliend asked us to create an online profile/business card generator and so we did, using JavaScript to make it interactive.

## Layout

First, we followed Zeplin project's guidelines and built the project structure using Adalab Web starter kit, created branches and divided it into partials so that we could all work remotely and efficiently.

## Programming our web

We set three main sections: design, fill and share. These three sections allowed the user to add their personal information to the card and personalize, and these changes are automatically rendered in the preview section on top (mobile) or on the right (for tablet and desktop version).
Each section is collapsable so it won't disturb the user while interacting with other fieldsets.[^1]

### :paintbrush: Design

- [ ] The user can decide the color combination from three palettes provided. Once selected, the elements in the card preview will change accordingly.

### :keyboard: Fill

### :incoming_envelope: Share

[^1] Default values are: the first palette for design fieldset, placeholder text and non-existent links for social media, and an error message if the user did not submit all the required data to create a card.
